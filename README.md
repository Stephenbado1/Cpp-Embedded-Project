# Cpp-Embedded-Project
Group project created for the Fall 2023 Embedded Systems course at Sam Houston State University.
This project uses C++ code to control an MBED LPC1768 Microprocessor with working servos, IR Sensors, 7-segment displays(1 digit and 4 digit), and a piezo buzzer for sound output. 
The system is a marble drop game designed to use servo positions to guide the marble into 5 different holes all with separate scores and buzzer sounds and tracks attempts to determine whether the score limit is reached or not. The 4 digit 7-segment display tracks user's current score and the single digit 7-segment display tracks remaining attempts.
